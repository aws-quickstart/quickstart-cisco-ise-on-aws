== Deployment state machine

As shown in <<architecture2>>, this Partner Solution includes a deployment state machine to form a two-node {partner-product-short-name} deployment.

[#architecture2]
.Deployment state machine architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-cisco-ise-on-aws-architecture-DeploymentStateMachine.png[DeploymentStateMachineArchitecture]

The deployment state machine performs the following functions:

. Check {partner-product-short-name} status to verify that both {partner-product-short-name} instances are up and ready.
. Set the first {partner-product-short-name} instance as the primary administrator node (primary PAN or PPAN) of a new {partner-product-short-name} deployment.
. Register the second {partner-product-short-name} instance as the secondary administrator node (secondary PAN or SPAN) in the same {partner-product-short-name} deployment.
. Check the deployment sync status to verify that both nodes are synchronized.

NOTE: CloudFormation deploys the state machine architecture towards the end of the stack creation.

== PAN failover state machine

As shown in <<architecture3>>, this Partner Solution deploys a failover state machine to promote SPAN to PPAN in the event of a PPAN failure.

[#architecture3]
.Failover state machine architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-cisco-ise-on-aws-architecture-FailoverStateMachine.png[FailoverStateMachineArchitecture]

Failover keeps access to the Cisco web console open and enables certain aspects of {partner-product-short-name} to continue running. The failover state machine performs the following functions:

. Detect PPAN failures.
. Verify accessibility of the API Gateway on SPAN.
. In the event of PPAN failure, promote SPAN to PPAN.
. Confirm that PAN failover has completed and is successful.

== Auto failover

If you set the Auto Failover (`AutoFailover`) parameter to `ENABLED`, the deployment schedules the failover state machine to run periodically as an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html[Amazon EventBridge rule^].

NOTE: The deployment sets `AutoFailover` to `DISABLED` by default in the templates for two reasons. First, the Partner Solution only deploys two {partner-product-short-name} nodes. Second, auto failover can result in a 30-minute downtime while services are restarted.

== Parameter Store
This Partner Solution stores the following configurable parameters in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store^].

|Name |Description

|`ADMIN_PASSWORD` | {partner-product-short-name} admin password used by Lambda for Extensible RESTful Services (ERS)/OpenAPI requests.
|`ADMIN_USERNAME` |{partner-product-short-name} admin user name used by Lambda for ERS/OpenAPI requests.
|`Maintenance` |Values are `DISABLED` (default) or `ENABLED`. When `ENABLED`, Lambda skips health checks and PAN failover.
|`Primary_FQDN` |Fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of PPAN.
|`Primary_IP` |IPv4 address of PPAN.
|`Secondary_FQDN` |FQDN of SPAN.
|`Secondary_IP` |IPv4 address of SPAN.
|`SyncStatus` |Latest synchronization status of the {partner-product-short-name} deployment from the last health check.
