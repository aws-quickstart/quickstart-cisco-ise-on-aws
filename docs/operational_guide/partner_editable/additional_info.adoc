.Partner Solution deployment state machine architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-cisco-ise-on-aws-architecture-DeploymentStateMachine.png[DeploymentStateMachineArchitecture]

As shown in <<architecture2>>, this Partner Solution deployment state machine performs the following steps to form a two-node {partner-product-short-name} deployment:

. Checks {partner-product-short-name} status: _Verify both {partner-product-short-name} instances are up and ready._
. Sets Primary PAN: _Make the first {partner-product-short-name} instance as the primary admin node (primary PAN or PPAN) of a new {partner-product-short-name} deployment._
. Registers Secondary Node: _Register the second {partner-product-short-name} instance as the secondary admin node (secondary PAN or SPAN) into the same {partner-product-short-name} deployment._
. Checks Sync Status: _Check the deployment status and verify that SPAN has synchronized to SPAN._

NOTE: CloudFormation deploys the state machine architecture towards the end of the stack creation.

== PAN Failover State Machine
[#architecture3]
.Partner Solution Failover State Machine architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-cisco-ise-on-aws-architecture-FailoverStateMachine.png[FailoverStateMachineArchitecture]

When PPAN fails, we need promote SPAN as primary to re-gain access to the Cisco administrative web console and to allow certain aspects of {partner-product-short-name} services to continue to work. As shown in <<architecture3>>, this Partner Solution Failover State Machine performs the following steps to detect PPAN failures and to promote SPAN to primary:

. Check PPAN Status: _Detect PPAN failures._
. Check SPAN Getway Status: _Verify whether the API gateway on SPAN is accessible._
. Perform Failover: _Promote SPAN to PPAN._
. Check Failover Successful: _Confirm the PAN failover has completed and is successful._

.AutoFailover
****
NOTE: *AutoFailover* is an input parameter to the CloudFormation stacks. When `ENABLED`, the stacks will schedule this Partner Solution Failover State Machine to run periodically as https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rules.html[an Amazon EventBridge rule^]. This is `DISABLED` by default in the templates, because there are only two {partner-product-short-name} nodes and because it may incur ~ 30-minute downtime while the services are restarted after PPAN fails and SPAN is promoted to primary.

== Parameter Store
This Partner Solution stores its configurable parameters in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html[AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store^]. The parameters are:
