== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare your AWS account
==== AWS Marketplace
* Subscribe to {marketplace_listing_url}[{partner-product-name} in AWS Marketplace^].

==== Service Quotas
You might need to request service quotas increases if your existing workloads use these resources and if this Quick Start deployment could result in exceeding your current quotas. The https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home[Service Quotas console^] displays your usage and quotas for some aspects of some services. If necessary, request service quota increases for the following resources in the Region where you plan to deploy {partner-product-short-name}.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html[What is Service Quotas?^] and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html[AWS service quotas^].
