== Postdeployment steps
After deployment, you must do the following:

* Attach the workload VPCs to the on-premise network via https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/index.html[AWS Site-to-Site VPN^] or the like.
* Update the VPC route table for the workload subnets. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/WorkWithRouteTables.html#AddRemoveRoutes[Add and remove routes from a route table^].
