== FAQ

*Q.* I encountered a *CREATE_FAILED* error when I launched the Quick Start.

*A.* If AWS CloudFormation fails to create the stack, relaunch the template with *Rollback on failure* set to *Disabled*. This setting is under *Advanced* in the AWS CloudFormation console on the *Configure stack options* page. With this setting, the stack’s state is retained, and the instance keeps running so that you can troubleshoot the issue.

// Customize this answer if needed. For example, if you’re deploying on Linux instances, either provide the location for log files on Linux or omit the final sentence. If the Quick Start has no EC2 instances, revise accordingly (something like "and the assets keep running").

WARNING: When you set *Rollback on failure* to *Disabled*, you continue to incur AWS charges for this stack. Delete the stack when you finish troubleshooting.

For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html[Troubleshooting AWS CloudFormation^].

*Q.* I encountered a size-limitation error when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates.

*A.* Launch the Quick Start templates from the links in this guide or from another S3 bucket. If you deploy the templates from a local copy on your computer or from a location other than an S3 bucket, you might encounter template-size limitations. For more information, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cloudformation-limits.html[AWS CloudFormation quotas^].

*Q.* I encountered a CREATE_FAILED on DeploymentWaitCondition with WaitCondition timed out. Received 0 conditions when expecting 1 when I deployed the AWS CloudFormation templates for ISE workloads and ISE instance.

*A.* Go to Step Functions > State machines > DeploymentStateMachine-xxxxxxxxxxxx, drill into the last execution, and look for the failed event(s) in the events table. Please verify the DNS attributes of your VPC and ensure it enabled for both https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-support[DNS attributes (enableDnsHostnames and enableDnsSupport) in the VPC^] if it fails in step: If ISE is up and running
