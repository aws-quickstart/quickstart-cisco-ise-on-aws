.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-cisco-ise-on-aws-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC)* configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
** In public subnets,
*** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
** In private subnets,
*** Single {partner-product-short-name} instance for each subnet, and
*** AWS Network Load Balacer listener to distribute RADIUS and TACACS+ requests between the two {partner-product-short-name} instances.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

* AWS Route53 for DNS resolution between the two {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* AWS Lambda functions for health check, deployment, and failover between the two {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* Amazon Step Functions state machines for deployment and failover between the two {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store for storing state information about the two {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* Amazon CloudWatch for logging and generating events about the two {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* Amazon EventBridge rules for invoking the Amazon Step Function state machine.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) for email notifications related to:
** forming a two-node {partner-product-short-name} deployment,
** performing health check on the {partner-product-short-name} deployment, and
** monitoring the {partner-product-short-name} instances and to automate Policy Administration Node (PAN) fail over.
