.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-cisco-ise-on-aws-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed NAT gateways for outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** One {partner-product-short-name} primary and one {partner-product-short-name} secondary node deployed to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.
** A Network Load Balancer attached to the private subnets. The load balancer distributes Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) and Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Plus (TACACS+) requests among {partner-product-short-name} nodes.
* Amazon Route 53 for Domain Name Service (DNS) resolution between {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* AWS Lambda for health checks, deployment, and failover of {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* AWS Step Functions for state machines to deploy and manage failover of {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* Parameter Store, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, for storing state information about {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* Amazon CloudWatch for logging and generating events about {partner-product-short-name} instances.
* Amazon EventBridge for rules to invoke Step Function state machines.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to manage subscriptions to deployment, health check, and failover email notifications.
