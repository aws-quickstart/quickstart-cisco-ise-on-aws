image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets:
** Single ISE instance for each subnets.
** AWS Network Load Balacer listener to distribute RADIUS and TACACS+ requests between the two ISE instances.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.

* AWS Route53 for DNS resolution between the two ISE instances.
* AWS Lambda function to form a two-node (Small) ISE deployment.
* AWS Lambda function to monitor the ISE instances for automatic PAN (Policy Administration Node) fail over.



[.small]#* The template that deploys this Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
